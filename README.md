# image-map-demo
Demo of how to use an image map in HTML, with some interactivity in JavaScript.

Inside `demo.html`, there is an image map of the United States.
When you click certain states, information wil appear on the right side of the page.

This project is very basic and is mostly intended for my own reference, so I have a 
place to access some simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that I wrote.
